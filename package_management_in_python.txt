virtual environment setup
=========================

----->why we use this concept?
ans: we use to download and install lib or python packages in the particular individual project folder.


steps:
    1. install virtualenv
        [pip install virtualenv]
    2. type this command for the folder you want..
        [virtualenv <directory_name>]
    2. (better) 
        python -m venv <directory_name>
    3. activate the Scripts for virtual environment.
        [<directory_name>/Scripts/activate]

    ---You should see the name of your virtual environment in brackets on your terminal      line e.g. (mypython).

    4. after finishing work deactivate
        [deactivate]

=========================
creating requirements.txt
=========================

----->why we use it?
ans: we use this to list down all the package name with the versions so that if we share this project with someone can install all the dependencies at one command

steps:
    1. install from someones project shared to you
        [pip install -r requirements.txt]
    2. [pip freeze > requirements.txt] 
        {note: can use many times as it will replace the previous one}
        {caution: use this command after setting up virtual environment and installing certain packages.}
    3. to uninstall the packages 
	[pip uninstall -r requirements.txt] -- deletes one by one
	[pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y] -- delete all
